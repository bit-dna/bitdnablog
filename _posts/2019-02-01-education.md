A discount can help accelerate a slow-moving deal, create goodwill, and give you leverage for requesting concessions.

But you’ll only reap these benefits by discounting strategically -- not whenever your prospect asks for one.

Promising your prospect a discount before the actual negotiation can have three negative consequences:

<ol>
<li>The buyer subconsciously attributes less value to you and your product. After all, if its ROI is what you claim, why are you so willing to sell it for less?</li>
<li>The focus shifts from value to price. Instead of talking and thinking about your product’s potential impact on their business, the prospect is thinking about how much it costs.</li>
<li>You lose some of your bargaining power. Successful negotiations require give-and-take.
If you offer a discount in the beginning stages of the sales process, you’ll miss the opportunity to ask for something in return because you don’t yet know what your prospect wants. That sets a dangerous precedent of one-way</li>
</ol>

If you offer a discount in the beginning stages of the sales process, you’ll miss the opportunity to ask for something in return because you don’t yet know what your prospect wants. That sets a dangerous precedent of one-way concessions.

When the time comes to put together the actual agreement, the buyer will be accustomed to getting what they ask for without giving anything up.

Of course, responding to discount inquiries during the actual negotiation is challenging too. You must satisfy your prospect’s expectations without destroying your profit margin.

If you’re struggling to find the right words, use these replies throughout the sales conversation. And if your prospect says, "It costs too much," we've got a few answers for you here.

1. “You’re asking the right person. But before we discuss discounting, let’s figure out what you’re looking for in an offering. That will allow me to give you a far more accurate estimate."

If the price of your product or service largely depends on the individual prospect’s needs, goals, and situation, it’s too early to discuss discounts. Without knowing the final value of the deal, you can’t determine a rate that will both satisfy them and keep you in business.
